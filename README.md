# Employee Directory

An app for sorting and filtering employee information (first and last names and email addresses) retrieved from the [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/). This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Description

Given a table of random employee data from the Random User API, when a user loads this page they are able to view 50 employees' names and email addresses, search the table by letter, and sort the results in descending order by first name, last name, and email address. 

## Development & Installation

With the repository cloned, run the following commands for development and testing:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
